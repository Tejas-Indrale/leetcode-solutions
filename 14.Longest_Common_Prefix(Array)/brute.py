ðŸ“š Concepts Used:
-----------------
- for loop: To iterate through indices and strings.
- if not strs: To handle empty list edge case.
- s[i] != strs[0][i]: To compare character at same index in all strings.
- strs[0][:i]: Slicing to return prefix up to a point of mismatch.
- List[str] and -> str: Python type hinting.

ðŸŽ¯ What We Learn:
-----------------
- How to find the longest common prefix among multiple strings.
- String indexing and slicing in Python.
- Handling edge cases like empty input.
- Efficient early termination when mismatch is found.
- Useful real-world string pattern problem seen in coding interviews.
